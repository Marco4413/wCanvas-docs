### How to Generate the Docs

First you must have `jsdoc` installed, if you don't have it you can download it using `npm`:
 - `npm install -g jsdoc`

If Somehow the above-mentioned method of installing `jsdoc` doesn't work, then
follow the instructions from: https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc

After you've installed `jsdoc` you can now run the following command to build the docs:
 - `jsdoc --verbose -c ./conf.json`
